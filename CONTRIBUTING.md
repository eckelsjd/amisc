## Contributing to amisc
You might be here if you want to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose a new feature
- Write unit tests
- Add to the documentation.

We use [Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to host code and documentation, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Submitting pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (bug fixes, new features, docs, etc.)

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
1. If you are adding a feature or making major changes, first create the issue in Github.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add to `/tests`.
1. If you've made major changes, update the `/docs`.
1. Ensure the test suite passes (`pdm run test`).
1. Follow [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines when adding a commit message.
1. Ensure all `pre-commit` checks pass. Pro tip: use `pdm lint` to help.
1. Issue the pull request!

Use [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to set up your development environment. An example contribution workflow is shown here:

```shell
# Fork the repo on Github
git clone https://github.com/<your-user-name>/amisc.git
cd amisc
pdm install
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

# Make local changes

pdm run test  # make sure tests pass
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: adding a bugfix"
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>

# Go to Github and "Compare & Pull Request" on your fork
# For your PR to be merged:
  # squash all your commits on your branch (interactively in an IDE most likely)
  # rebase to the top of origin/main to include new changes from others

git fetch
git rebase -i main your-branch  # for example

# Resolve any conflicts
# Your history now looks something like this:
#              o your-branch
#             /
# ---o---o---o main

# You can delete the branch and fork when your PR has been merged!
```
